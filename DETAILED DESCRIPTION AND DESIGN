A specific manufacturing company wants us to design their main factories database. Hereâ€™s the information that we gather: 

Employees are identified by an ID, and their names, phone numbers, gender, salary, and sales must be recorded.
Customers are identified by an ID, and their name, mail must be recorded.
Factories are identified by an ID, and their name, phone numberi location, and manufacturing target must be recorded.
All manufactured products identified by an ID and their price, type, average quant and manufacturing duration must be recorded.
Store ID, date, quant information about orders.
Store ID, transportation type, and transportation cost information about shipping.
Store ID, net price, target sales, demand information about sales.
Sales made are shipped from factory to customers.
All employees work in one specific factory.
Products are produced in factories. Each product can produce in each factory.
Factories can make sales. Factories sell products to customers.
Employees took orders from customers.
A factory can receive more than one order. At the same time, each order can be received by more than one factory.
Each ordered product will be produced. Every manufactured product will also be sold.
Every product sold will be shipped by the company.
Each sale has its own unique shipping. Each shipment belongs to at least one sale.
Each sales must have a sales ID and each order must have an order ID.
Each employee can receive more than one order. Every order must be taken by an employee.
A product can be ordered more than once. Only one product can be ordered per order. The product will be produced after each order.
A different order number is assigned for each order. Only one type of product can be ordered in an order. If the customer wishes to order a different product, a different order number is assigned to him. The quantity of the order depends on the customer.
